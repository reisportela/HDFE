# Introduction

- we live on the era of "big data"

- availability of microdata for researchers is better than ever

- easy to gain access to large administrative data sets

- these ”large data sets” open up research possibilities

- but they also pose many technical challenges

# Introduction

- large and more detailed data sets make it possible to control for different sources of unobserved heterogeneity

- examples are:
  - Employer-employee level data
  - Hospital-doctor-patient data
  - School-class-teacher-student level data
  - Loan-borrower-bank data

- these data are sometimes described as [multilevel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model) or
[hierarchical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model)

- repeated observations allow for the introduction of additional error components that account for unobserved heterogeneity

# Introduction

- if error components are uncorrelated with observed explanatory variables we can use [mixed models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model) (error components are treated as random effects)

- if error components are correlated with observed explanatory variables then they need to be treated as fixed effects

- introducing fixed effects in a linear regression amounts to modelling the error component using dummy variables

- with only one error component this is the usual fixed effects panel data regression

# Single fixed effects model

- suppose that you want to estimate the model
\begin{equation*}
y_{it}=\mu+\mathbf{x}_{it}^{\prime}\mathbf{\beta+u}_{i}\mathbf{\eta}+\alpha_{i}+u_{it}
\end{equation*}

where you have observations of multiple individuals observed over time. The subscript *i* indexes individual and *t* stands for time.
Strict exogeneity, $E(u_{it}|\mathbf{x}_{it}^{\prime},\mathbf{u}_{i},\alpha_{i})=0$, is assumed.

$\mathbf{x}_{it}$ - time-varying individual level observed explanatory variables

$\mathbf{u}_{i}$ - time invariant individual level observed explanatory variables

$\alpha_{i}$ - time invariant individual level unobserved explanatory variables

# Single fixed effects model

- the vector $\mathbf{\beta}$ can be estimated by running the regression
\begin{equation*}
y_{it}-\overline{y}_{i}=(\mathbf{x}_{it}^{\prime }-\overline{\mathbf{x}}
_{i}^{\prime })\mathbf{\beta +}\widetilde{u}_{it}
\end{equation*}

- the estimates for $\mathbf{\beta}$ are the same as if we had included a dummy variable per individual

- time invariant individual level observed variables are absorbed

- this will work regardless of the number of individuals (high-dimensional)

# Two high dimensional fixed effects

- an example: the AKM wage regression:
\begin{equation*}
y_{it}=\mu+\mathbf{x}_{it}^{\prime}\mathbf{\beta+w}_{j(i,t)}\mathbf{\gamma+u}_{i}\mathbf{\eta}+\mathbf{q}_{j(i,t)}\mathbf{\rho+}\alpha_{i}+\phi_{j(i,t)}+\mu_{t}+u_{it}
\end{equation*}

$y_{it}$ - wage of worker \textit{i }at time \textit{t}

$\mathbf{x}_{it}$ - time-varying worker observed explanatory variables

$\mathbf{w}_{j(i,t)}$ - time-varying firm observed explanatory variables

$\mathbf{u}_{i}$ - time invariant worker observed explanatory variables

$\mathbf{q}_{j(i,t)}$ - time invariant firm observed explanatory variables

$\alpha_{i}$ - time invariant worker unobserved explanatory variables

$\phi_{j(i,t)}$ - time invariant firm unobserved explanatory variables

$\mu_{t}$ - unobserved time effect

$u_{it}$ - usual error term

# Two high dimensional fixed effects

- in practice this is what is estimated:

\begin{equation*}
y_{it}=\mu+\mathbf{x}_{it}^{\prime}\mathbf{\beta+w}_{j(i,t)}\mathbf{\gamma+}\theta_{i}+\psi_{j(i,t)}+\mu_{t}+u_{it}
\end{equation*}

where $\theta_{i}\equiv \alpha_{i}+\mathbf{u}_{i}\mathbf{\eta}$ and $\psi_{j}\equiv \mathbf{q}_{j}\mathbf{\rho}+\phi_{j}$

# Estimation with two FEs

- rewrite the two fixed-effects model in matrix form:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}+\mathbf{D}_{1}\mathbf{\alpha }+\mathbf{D}_{2}\mathbf{\gamma}+\mathbf{\epsilon}
\end{equation*}

- $\mathbf{D}_{1}$ is $n\times G_{1}$ and $\mathbf{D}_{2}$ is $n \times G_{2}$ and both $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ are large numbers

- direct estimation of this model is complicated

# Estimation with two FEs

- but a "zigzag" approach is simple to implement:
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{\beta }^{(j+1)}=\left( \mathbf{X}^{\prime }\mathbf{X}\right) ^{-1}
\mathbf{X}^{\prime }\left( \mathbf{Y}-\mathbf{D}_{1}\mathbf{\alpha }^{(j)}-\mathbf{D}_{2}\mathbf{\gamma }^{(j)}\right) \\
\mathbf{\alpha }^{(j)}=\left( \mathbf{D}_{1}^{\prime }\mathbf{D}_{1}\right)^{-1}\mathbf{D}_{1}^{\prime }\left( \mathbf{Y}-\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta }
^{(j)}-\mathbf{D}_{2}\mathbf{\gamma }^{(j)}\right) \\
\mathbf{\gamma }^{(j)}=\left( \mathbf{D}_{2}^{\prime }\mathbf{D}_{2}\right)
^{-1}\mathbf{D}_{2}^{\prime }\left( \mathbf{Y}-\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta }^{(j)}-\mathbf{D}_{1}\mathbf{\alpha }^{(j)}\right)
\end{array}
\right]
$$

- take advantage of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem

- standard errors (clustered or not) can also be easily calculated

- the degrees of freedom of the regression are
$$
dof=n-(k+G_{1}+G_{2}-M)
$$

where $M$ is the number of coefficients dropped (or mobility groups)

# Extending the 2hdfe linear model

- this iterative estimation technique can be extended to several sets of fixed effects
$$
\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}+\mathbf{D}\mathbf{\alpha}+\mathbf{\epsilon}
$$
 where $\mathbf{D}=[\mathbf{D}_1 \mathbf{D}_2 ... \mathbf{D}_F]$ is a matrix containing several fixed effects or interacted fixed effects. Eg:
$$
\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta }+\mathbf{D}\mathbf{\alpha }+\mathbf{L}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{\gamma }+\mathbf{\epsilon }
$$

$\mathbf{L}\mathbf{D}$ are interactions between the fixed effect and the variables

- we can use the same approach as for 2hdfe to estimate these models

- with more than 2 hdfes calculation of the d.o.f. is complicated. But do we really care?

# General considerations

- remember that with short-panels the estimates of the fes may be inconsistent

- but averages, kernel-densities, etc should be fine!

- with 2 hdfe estimates of the fes may only be compared **within** each mobility group. That is why researchers work with the "largest connected set"

- with more than 2 fes one can find a connected set using the algorithm of Weeks and Williams (1964). Within this set estimates of fes are comparable

- correlation between the estimates of the fixed effects may be biased (eg: limited mobility)

- is mobility endogenous?

# What about nonlinear models?

- many nonlinear models are estimated using iterative algorithms based on linear regression

- an example are Generalized Linear Models estimated by Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS)

- another example are nonlinear models that can be estimated recursively using linear regression (the NLS algorithm)

- ability to estimate does not translate into consistency of estimators

# GLM models can be estimated by IRLS

- examples of GLM models where we can add fes:

    + Poisson regression
    + logit regression
    + probit regression
    + cloglog regression
    + negative binomial
    + gamma regression

- we need to worry about the incidental parameter problem (IPP)

- the IPP is not a concern for Poisson regression

- There are approaches to correct the IPP bias

# Advice for estimation

- prepare a "clean and lean dataset"
    + Keep only needed variables
    + Drop missing values
    + Drop singletons

- if you plan on doing secondary analysis of fes restrict your data to a "connected set"

- if you use clustered standard errors make sure the number of clusters is high enough (+50)

- make sure you understand well the package you are using
